All of a sudden I'm in a dream (what can be so cool?)
Just looking at you has made it begin (look like me or you)

What Juicy say? Shut the fuck up

RIP Bankroll, RIP Nipsey
RIP Smoke Dawg, RIP Jimmy
RIP Pop Smoke, this shit got me stressed
RIP X-X-X-X-X

I got three oppositions that might fuck around and blow (blow)
I just plot then I watch get them bust down for low
Ooh, that's Flock he got the glock
And he got the drop, don't get shot
You get caught slippin', slippin', slippin', slippin'
You gon' get mopped
I can't tell if he real or pussy (hmm)
I'm tryna decipher
Me and my brody used to live a good life now he a lifer
Now he a killer now he gorilla
Tryna be dope now he a dealer
Moving that gas come get a fill up
Premium grade, no Reggie Miller, uh

IPhone one, pull up take it, uh
By iPhone two, get it with the crew
IPhone eight, niggas had the Drac' (dot-dot-dot)
IPhone X, leave a nigga late

Bitch, I'm not with that cappin' or extra fakin'
And I'm sending them shots with no explanation
Bullets rain on your block, precipitation
When me and Jam slide no miscommunication
I was only sixteen when the house got raided
I was only thirteen and incarcerated
Been this way since a child need no validation
You gon' die from this smoke, cancer patient

RIP to explicit I'm X-X-X
Shoutout Tobi, I die for my men that's facts
If I'm taking your shit you can't get that back
Do not turn his music on that's that cap
7.62 shit that's my type no Saweetie
I might splatter his blood on the wall, no graffiti
Stick in my hand do a spell like I'm Kiki
Bad bitch wanna do six-nine no Fefe

IPhone one, pull up take it, uh
By iPhone two, get it with the crew
IPhone eight, niggas had the Drac' (dot-dot-dot)
IPhone X, leave a nigga late

Bitch I'm not with that cappin' or extra fakin'
And I'm sending them shots with no explanation
Bullets rain on your block, precipitation
When me and Jam slide no miscommunication

I was only sixteen when the house got raided
I was only thirteen and incarcerated
Been this way since a child need no validation
You gon' die from this smoke cancer patient

All of a sudden I'm in a dream
Just looking at you has made it begin (X-X-X-X-X, yeah)

It's a crazy world but I know how to move
Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom
I'm still up like fuck a snooze
Fuck a loss and fuck a lose
Nigga any day it could be fuck you
Buss you then buss at you
I ain't tryna be working when I'm forty-two
I don't like new niggas on me, who is you?
Pardon me I'm coming through
When I do its 50K on me
Got 200K in a rainy day fund like let it rain on me
They don't know who to point out
So they going to put the blame on me
I always hear the same story
Let a bitch try to take something from me (bitch)
I'll show a bitch why she should've never came for it

IPhone one, pull up take it, uh
By iPhone two, get it with the crew
IPhone eight, niggas had the Drac' (dot-dot-dot)
IPhone X, leave a nigga late

How the hell they want me to love when they taught me to hate?
How the hell they want me to love when they taught me to hate?
How the hell they want me to love when they taught me to hate?
How the hell they want me to love when they taught me to hate?

All of a sudden, I'm in a dream
