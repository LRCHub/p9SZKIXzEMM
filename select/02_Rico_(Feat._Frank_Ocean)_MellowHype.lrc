[00:21.02] I'm thankful for my position I was given in life
[00:23.92] Cause I know some people living who ain't living this life
[00:26.68] Read about starved children who ain't eating this right
[00:29.28] Drug lords declare war, selling cheaper the price
[00:32.00] Stunting dummy drug money, yeah them sneakers is nice
[00:34.60] Get your swag from the blacks selling bags of the white
[00:37.47] Niggas can't get a job, so we self-employed
[00:40.13] If the coppers come a-knocking, we gon' help that boy
[00:42.96] Bail money, welcome back home out of jail money
[00:45.32] White girl pale money, sunny when we sell money

[00:53.28] Dusty paper, stale money, I thought they restricted it
[00:56.57] Did for most people but we out here getting it
[01:19.57] 
[01:04.86] Bunch of hands under her dress, we get the feeling that she's faded
[01:07.97] And she's willing screaming Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
[01:11.36] The sex, it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
[01:13.92] Villain wolves screaming kill them all, fuck 'em all

[01:28.08] She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
[01:30.75] She claim to like the stores and the clothes
[01:32.79] Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homie
[01:36.02] Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good
[01:38.88] It's so good, she can't flaunt her thing on me
[01:41.43] She can be full of swag, drive a Jag
[01:43.68] Poppin' tags on the Ave but she can't get her cake from me
[01:46.95] That sounded like the hook I threw at her and the swag I reeled her in
[01:50.43] Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
[01:52.97] Like baby what's the deal with it? Seem to be attracted
[01:55.37] By the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
[01:58.25] Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
[02:00.46] Dippin' with the duffles I hold, if we are a couple, let's go
[02:03.46] To the place where we lead in the life to some sleep
[02:06.55] Bring the pipe, blow the weed, punchlines to be received
[02:34.55] 
[02:09.47] Bunch of hands under her dress, we get the feeling that she's faded
[02:12.82] And she's willing screaming Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
[02:15.99] The sex, it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
