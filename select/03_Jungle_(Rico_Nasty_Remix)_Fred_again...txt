Turned to, turned to, turned to lion, I eat nightmares for supper
Brrow-brrow on command and I'll sick 'em on another

Kill or be killed, drill or be drilled
It's heating up, how the temperature feel?
We going bananas, do what you feel
I don't got no manners, don't got no chill
Every man for themself, it get hot in the field
Back to the jungle, I'm gripping the wheel

Every pose, I'm like, "Catch me candid" (Blaow, blaow)
I like cinnamon, I like candy (Uh)
Make him think he can, but he can't @ me, no (Blaow, blaow)
Hating ass bitch got my name in her throat
Get your ass up, baby, get lost
