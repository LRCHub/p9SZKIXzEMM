Just like the morning comes from the night
And changes everything in sight
I'm walking by a lot of open doors
But I never heard that sound before
Always joking about it
Always I try to figure it out
Always better not thinking about it
It's easier to fall in love
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
I get that feeling every time that You care to Mambo
I think I'll go right by that door again today
Perhaps not the same way
I'm thinking who is gonna show it if You don't
I'm not so sure that You won't
Always joking about it
Always I try ti figure it out
Always better not thinking about it
It's easier to fall in love
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
I get that feeling every time that You care to Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
I get that feeling every time that You care to Mambo
So would You show me what You do again today
You say well that can be arranged
But I won't dance if You're just gonna smile
You say that's gonna take a while
Always joking about it
Always I try ti figure it out
Always better not thinking about it
It's easier to fall in love
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
I get that feeling every time that You care to Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
I get that feeling every time that You care to Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
Oh Rico Mambo
Oh Rico Mambo yeah
