Know a, know a little freak in hollywood
Sucks, sucks on dick
(Take it, take it, take it, take it)
Does it real good

Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
You heard what I said, bitch, take it to the head (take it)
Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head
Don't be scared, get that bread, bitch, take it to the head (take it)

Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
Drink until you're dead, bitch, take it to the head (take it)
Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
You heard what I said, bitch, take it to the head (take it)

Take it to the head (to the head) like a leaf
Stand-up chick but I love her on her knees
She got a passport full of stamps from overseas
You can't fuck with her for free, she likes Birkin and Celine

Got a sweet tooth from rolling up some Girl Scout cookie
I'm her favorite rapper, she want me to autograph that pussy
I belong on TV, I got hoes going wild
She rub powder on her gums, call it coke and a smile

Super freak but she shy, don't want no one to know
Bust a couple rubber bands, she gon' put on a show
Man, that pussy got power, that pussy got control
She should be a politician how she up and down them poles (let go)

Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
You heard what I said, bitch, take it to the head (take it)
Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head
Don't be scared, get that bread, bitch, take it to the head (take it)

Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
Drink it 'til you're dead, bitch, take it to the head (take it)
Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
You heard what I said, bitch (woah), take it to the head (Rico)

It ain't nothing to throw some thousands if she worthy
Why look at a hater? Don't look at the price on the purchase
You want that back-and-forth, ain't interested in no Verzuz
It's funny how the people scared to take risks can make me nervous

She says she'd like to make it clap and wobble it in circles
If I keep it up, I can retire when I hit thirty
What make you think a dirty bitch ain't gonna do you dirty?
Nothing I do a maybe, that's 'cause everything for certain
Rico, talk to 'em

My bitches with the shits and that's the shit you bitches never with
She pop it up and do a split, she land it on them Benjamins
I put my faith in God before I ever trust a friend again
Man, I hope that he ain't lookin' when I do them lil' sinny-sins

We all like naked bitches, I guess it's a new syndicate
I own what I'm drivin', bitch, you know this ain't rented shit
If we start it up, we finish it, I don't gotta say this shit
Bitch, you heard what Juicy said, so go and get it juicy then

Drink until you pass out, then wake up and do it again
I see you got that ass out, so what? You gon' do it again
Flexin' with that cash out, I hope that you payin' your rent
And I'm so fucked up, bitches can't understand what I'm sayin' (yah)

Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
You heard what I said, bitch, take it to the head (take it)
Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head
Don't be scared, get that bread, bitch, take it to the head (take it)

Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
Drink until you're dead, bitch, take it to the head (take it)
Take it to the head (take it), take it to the head (take it)
You heard what I said, bitch, take it to the head (take it)

What Juicy say? He be like, "shut the fuck up"

It's the return of the mafia, real nigga's posse, yup
If you say our name, just like Candyman, we poppin' up
We know niggas hatin', got the world screamin', "Mafia"
You know you ain't stoppin' us, what the fuck you thought it was?

You get Desert Eagle beam 'til your cranium leak
Scarecrow or Sandman, double-R, but you see
When I pull this unit, it's a distant care unit
And I'll steal your blood type so they can't transfuse it

World war vet, hit a break, hit the deck
Keyser Soze, you should want a suspect
With a one-hitter quitter, and some shit that disfigure
In your hospital room to finish you off, nigga

It ain't shit to finish you, hand's on ten and two
I've been rich since twenty-two, do hits out the Bentley coupe
Ain't no lie, I been the truth, I make millions in the booth
Wet the whip up, ten and two, you can't see who been in through

I'm white, okay, pregnant blue, 'nother pack, send it through
You talk like these bitches do, I need like a bitch or two
You broke? She might switch on you, I know what these riches do
I've been lit and still ain't through, fuckin' fool
It's the return of the Mafia
